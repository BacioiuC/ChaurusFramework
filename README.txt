[ will write a better README a bit later ]

ChaurusFramework is mean to wrap up MOAI's base commands and to facilitate it's use. Since I come from a LUA + love2D background I find myself a bit on the awkward side
with MOAI's way of handling things. So, the goal here is to bind together Love2D's "code mentality" with MOAI's awesomeness. Note that I'm not trying to create a Love2D
wrapper for MOAI.
